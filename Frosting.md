Chocolate Cream Cheese Buttercream Frosting:
1. In a large bowl, beat together butter and cream cheese until fluffy. Use a hand mixer or stand mixer for best results
2. Add in cocoa powder and vanilla extract. Beat until combined.
3. Beat in powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time. Add milk as necessary to make a spreadable consistency. The frosting should be very thick and will thicken even more if refrigerated.
